## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

| Directory | File | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| profiles | profiles.html | ![screenshot](documentation/html-profiles-validation.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| accounts | signup.html | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/validation/html/html-validation-signup.png) | I am aware of this error from the validator and is happening due to allauth. I have attempted to remove the `aria-describedby` in the signup form however I was unable to fix it for that reason error will still show up in the validator. |
